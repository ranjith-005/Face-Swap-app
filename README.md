🚀 Face Swap Using OpenCV & Flask

    

🎭 Overview

This project implements a Face Swap tool using OpenCV, Dlib, and Flask to swap faces between images seamlessly. It supports both a Jupyter Notebook-based implementation and a Flask web application for easy usability.

📌 Features

✅ Detects and extracts facial features using DLIB/OpenCV.
✅ Seamless face swapping with color and shape adjustments.
✅ Works on multiple images and real-time webcam feed.
✅ Flask-based web app for easy face swapping without coding.
✅ Uses deep learning for accurate facial landmark detection.
